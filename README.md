## This Is my first flutter app with Appwite
An app demo to help you quit smoking. 
It is a simple app demo built with Appwrite for Hacktoberfest 2021.

You count your cigarettes per day, and the cost and is saved in an appwrite document. This can be a rewarding way to cut down on your cigarette consumption with the goal of quitting.
As of right now the cost is based on the cost per carton in BC, Canada. A future feature - the user could add the brand and prices in their area.

A lot of this project is Frankensteined from the tutorials [React Bits (Damodar Lohani)](https://www.youtube.com/c/ReactBits) YouTube page - an amazing help. If you're looking to 
learn Flutter and Appwrite it's a top resource on both subjects.
